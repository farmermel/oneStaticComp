### Project Description

This repository is a recreation of a provided layout. I made decisions on theme, color scheme, and font while following the prescribed layout. I chose to make a site for a retirement community of milk cows. The color scheme and font choices were selected to be as light-hearted as the inspiration for the page. The layout is achieved using flex-box, and is usable on both larger screens and mobile devices.

The icons are designed by:
'freepic' from [flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/).
