# oneStaticComp


### Project Description

This site is part of a static composition project to recreate a layout while making decisions on theme, color scheme, and font. I chose to make a site for a retirement community of milk cows. The color scheme and font choices were selected to be as light-hearted as the idea of a retirement community for milk cows. The layout is achieved using flex-box, and is usable on both larger screens and mobile devices.
